	<h3>What is the difference between non-semantic and semantic tags in HTML?</h3>
	<p>Semantic tags tell you what they're meant for in a readable way. For example, 
		nav is where navigation links go, and header is where a header goes. Non-semantic 
		tags are kind of the opposite. Tags like div and span don't say anything about what 
		they're supposed to contain.
	</p>

	<section>
		<h3>What are two (or more) benefits of using semantic tags?</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>They allow for better readability for the developer(s).</li>
			<li>They're more accessible for screen readers.</li>
			<li>They're easier to work with, since, being descriptive as they are, it's easier to remember what they do.</li>
